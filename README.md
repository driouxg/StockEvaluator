                                                            An area for displaying data (below title, and right of page)
                                                            
                                            
                                            
# Getting Started
We use a few libraries, tools, technologies that you will need to install such as CppRestSDK, SQLite, Node.js, and Electron.
If you'd like to setup your system to be able to debug Node.js modules using Visual Studio begin at step 1, otherwise proceed to step 5.

Steps:

1. Install CppRestSDK: Go to https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk and scroll down to the "Getting Started section", and click        vcpkg. If you are using a non-windows operating system choose the method that cooresponds to your devices' OS.
